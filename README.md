# Speedboat API

The Speedboat API powers the Speedboat dashboard.

## What's Speedboat?

Speedboat is a Discord bot focused on being a highly powerful and configurable moderation and utilitarian bot for Discord. Speedboat is complete with user interactions, filtering, a web pnel with advanced privilege controls, and the ability to request custom analytics for your servers.

Speedboat aims to eventually become a replacement for public moderation bots in servers that grow so large speed and efficiency become a stronger focus.

### Sound interesting?

If you are interested in using Speedboat in your server, message me on Discord. 

Please provide an invite alongside some general information about the server. As Speedboat is invite only, it's important that I have access direct access to you or your team to provide support and answer questions.

My friends in the Minecraft community are always welcome to use Speedboat. Just ask.

## What's the API?

The Speedboat API is a RESTful API that provides access to Speedboat's data. It is currently in development and generally has no 3rd party usages. If you think of something cool you'd like to do with the API, I'd love to hear about it!
